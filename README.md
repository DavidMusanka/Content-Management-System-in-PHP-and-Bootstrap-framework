# Content-Management-System-in-PHP-and-Bootstrap-framework
This is a CMS project I built using PHP and Bootstrap Framework, which most of the times I manage my content and also use it as a Blog


This CMS works on MySQL database and PHP version 7.x.y

Create a database and name it: phpcms then import the tables from the database folder; database/phpcms.sql
